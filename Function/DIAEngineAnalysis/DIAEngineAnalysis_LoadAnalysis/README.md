# Load Analysis
Analyzing whether the engine is working under the rated load level or exceeding
the recommended values

## Input 
-   Engine Load(%)
-   Engine RPM(rpm)
-   Speed (GPS)(km/h)
-   Trip Time

## Output
-   Graphs for engine is overloaded or not with respect to Engine Load, engine RPM, and Speed

The following is the flow chart for the algorithum:
